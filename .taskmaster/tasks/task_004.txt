# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Structured JSON Logging
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Add structured logging per Better Stack guidance, supporting info/debug/trace levels and JSON output.
# Details:
Use structlog==23.2.0 for JSON logging. No root logger; configure per module. Support --log-level option. Include timestamps, levels, and trace context. Output logs to stdout and optionally to file. Place logging config in /infrastructure/logging.py.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test log output format. Behave scenarios for log-level switching. Validate logs are JSON and contain required fields.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Scenario 1: Write failing test for basic structured logging setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Behave scenario that tests basic structured JSON logger initialization and verify it fails initially.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-07-20T21:00:48.922Z>
The basic structured logging setup has been fully implemented and verified. All requirements for structured JSON logging using structlog==23.2.0 are met, including logger initialization, required JSON fields, log level and file output options, and Better Stack compliance. All Behave scenarios in features/logging.feature are passing, confirming correct functionality and test coverage for info, debug, and trace levels, file output, trace context, and sensitive data handling. No further action is required for this subtask.
