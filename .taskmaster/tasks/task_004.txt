# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Structured JSON Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Add structured logging per Better Stack guidance, supporting info/debug/trace levels and JSON output.
# Details:
Use structlog==23.2.0 for JSON logging. No root logger; configure per module. Support --log-level option. Include timestamps, levels, and trace context. Output logs to stdout and optionally to file. Place logging config in /infrastructure/logging.py.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test log output format. Behave scenarios for log-level switching. Validate logs are JSON and contain required fields.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Scenario 1: Write failing test for basic structured logging setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Behave scenario that tests basic structured JSON logger initialization and verify it fails initially.
### Details:


## 2. Implement 1: Make basic logging scenario pass [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement minimal code to make the basic structured logging scenario pass - create logger configuration and basic JSON output.
### Details:


## 3. Refactor 1: Clean up basic logging implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Clean up the basic logging implementation for clarity and maintainability while ensuring tests remain green.
### Details:


## 4. Scenario 2: Write failing test for log level configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create a Behave scenario testing different log levels (info, debug, trace) and verify it fails initially.
### Details:


## 5. Implement 2: Make log level scenario pass [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Implement log level configuration support to make the log level scenario pass.
### Details:


## 6. Refactor 2: Clean up log level implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Refactor log level implementation for better structure and maintainability while keeping tests green.
### Details:


## 7. Scenario 3: Write failing test for Better Stack compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.6
### Description: Create a Behave scenario testing Better Stack guidance compliance for structured logging and verify it fails initially.
### Details:


## 8. Implement 3: Make Better Stack compliance scenario pass [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.7
### Description: Implement Better Stack compliance features to make the compliance scenario pass.
### Details:


## 9. Refactor 3: Final cleanup for production readiness [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.8
### Description: Final refactor of the complete structured logging implementation for production readiness while ensuring all tests remain green.
