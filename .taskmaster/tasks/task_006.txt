# Title: Fetch Basic Project Metadata from Azure DevOps REST APIs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement logic to fetch basic project information such as project details, properties, and configuration from Azure DevOps.
# Details:
Use azure-devops==7.1.0 or direct REST calls via httpx. Focus on core project endpoints: /core/projects/{projectId} for project details and basic configuration. Serialize results into domain objects. Place logic in /domain/metadata.py.

# Test Strategy:
Behave scenarios for project metadata endpoint. Unit test response parsing and error handling for basic project information.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research: Basic Project Metadata APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research Azure DevOps REST APIs for basic project metadata using Microsoft docs and azure-devops library documentation
### Details:
Use microsoft_docs_search and get-library-docs to understand best practices for fetching basic project information, authentication requirements, and response formats

## 2. Plan: Basic Project Metadata Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Based on research findings, create RED->GREEN->REFACTOR subtasks for implementing basic project metadata fetch
### Details:
After completing research, break down the implementation into focused BDD/TDD cycles with single scenarios
