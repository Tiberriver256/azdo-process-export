# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Resilient Async HTTP Client
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an async HTTP client with exponential backoff for 429/503, supporting up to 10 concurrent requests.
# Details:
Use httpx==0.27.0 with asyncio for concurrency. Integrate tenacity==8.2.2 for exponential backoff. Limit concurrency with asyncio.Semaphore(10). Centralize error handling for 429/503. Place client in /infrastructure/http_client.py.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test retry logic and concurrency limits. Behave scenarios for simulated transient failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Scenario 1: Write failing test for basic async HTTP GET [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Behave scenario testing basic async HTTP GET request functionality and verify it fails initially.
### Details:


## 2. Implement 1: Make basic GET scenario pass [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement minimal async HTTP client with httpx to make the basic GET scenario pass.
### Details:


## 3. Refactor 1: Clean up basic HTTP client [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Refactor basic HTTP client implementation for clarity and maintainability while keeping tests green.
### Details:


## 4. Scenario 2: Write failing test for concurrency control [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create a Behave scenario testing concurrent HTTP requests (max 10) and verify it fails initially.
### Details:


## 5. Implement 2: Make concurrency scenario pass [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Implement asyncio.Semaphore(10) concurrency control to make the concurrency scenario pass.
### Details:


## 6. Refactor 2: Clean up concurrency implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5

### Details:


## 7. Scenario 3: Write failing test for 429 rate limit handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.6
### Description: Create a Behave scenario testing HTTP 429 rate limit response handling and verify it fails initially.
### Details:


## 8. Implement 3: Make 429 handling scenario pass [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.7
### Description: Implement basic exponential backoff for 429 responses using tenacity to make the scenario pass.
### Details:


## 9. Refactor 3: Clean up backoff implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.8
### Description: Refactor exponential backoff implementation for better maintainability while keeping tests green.
### Details:


## 10. Scenario 4: Write failing test for 503 service unavailable handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.9
### Description: Create a Behave scenario testing HTTP 503 service unavailable response handling and verify it fails initially.
### Details:


## 11. Implement 4: Make 503 handling scenario pass [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.10
### Description: Extend exponential backoff to handle 503 responses to make the scenario pass.
### Details:


## 12. Refactor 4: Final cleanup for production readiness [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.11
### Description: Final refactor of the complete async HTTP client for production readiness while ensuring all tests remain green.
