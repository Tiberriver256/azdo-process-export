# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Repository and Screaming Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the project repository with a Screaming Architecture folder structure, separating domain logic from infrastructure details.
# Details:
Use Python 3.11+ for best async support. Structure folders as /domain, /infrastructure, /cli, /features. Add pyproject.toml for dependency management (prefer Poetry). Include .gitignore and README.md. Follow Screaming Architecture principles: domain objects and logic in /domain, API clients in /infrastructure, CLI entrypoint in /cli.

# Test Strategy:
Verify folder structure matches Screaming Architecture. Ensure all modules are importable and initial test runner executes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Repository and Initialize Git [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new project repository and initialize it with Git version control.
### Details:
Create a new directory for the project, initialize Git, and set up the initial commit. Add a .gitignore file tailored for Python projects.

## 2. Establish Screaming Architecture Folder Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the required folder structure following Screaming Architecture principles.
### Details:
Add /domain, /infrastructure, /cli, and /features folders. Ensure /domain is for domain logic, /infrastructure for API clients and utilities, /cli for CLI entrypoint, and /features for Behave scenarios.

## 3. Configure Dependency Management with Poetry [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up pyproject.toml using Poetry for dependency management and Python version specification.
### Details:
Initialize Poetry in the project root, specify Python 3.11+ in pyproject.toml, and add initial dependencies as needed. Ensure pyproject.toml is present and correctly configured.

## 4. Add Project Documentation and Metadata Files [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create README.md and ensure project metadata files are present.
### Details:
Write a README.md describing the project, architecture, and setup instructions. Ensure .gitignore and pyproject.toml are included in the repository.

## 5. Validate Initial Importability and Test Runner Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all modules are importable and set up an initial test runner.
### Details:
Add __init__.py files as needed. Set up Behave for BDD testing in /features. Confirm that all modules in /domain, /infrastructure, and /cli can be imported without errors.
